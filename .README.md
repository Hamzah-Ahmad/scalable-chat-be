- Setting up typescript in a project. 
    1. Run npx tsc --init
    2. Uncomment and update tsconfig ==> "outDir": "./dist"
    3. Uncomment and update tsconfig ==> "rootDir": "./src"   
    4. For shared packages using typescript, we need to build the project before using it in other services
    5. For prisma shared package, we need to also generate type files
        a. Uncomment tsconfig ==> "declaration": true,                          
        b. Uncomment tsconfig ==> "declarationMap": true,  (this is good for debugging but not totally necessary.)    
        c. In package.json file for prisma, add the following lines:
             "main": "dist/index.js",
             "types": "dist/index.d.ts",   


Explanation for part 5c commented below (visible in code, not MD preview):
<!-- Explanation of main and types
1. "main": "dist/index.js"
This tells Node.js where the entry point of your package is located. When someone imports your package (or when your monorepo project consumes it), Node will look at this file.

Example:
If your package is named @your-org/prisma-client and someone does:

js
Copy code
const prisma = require('@your-org/prisma-client');
Node will resolve to dist/index.js as the entry point of the package.

Do you need it?
Yes, if your package will be consumed by other parts of your monorepo or if it’s used as a dependency.
Even if you're only consuming it internally within your monorepo, you’ll need this to ensure correct imports.
2. "types": "dist/index.d.ts"
This field tells TypeScript where to find the type declarations for your package. When TypeScript consumes your package, it looks here to provide type safety and autocompletion.

Example:
If you import the Prisma client like:

ts
Copy code
import prisma from '@your-org/prisma-client';
TypeScript will look for dist/index.d.ts to provide the types for the imported prisma.

Do you need it?
Yes, if you are working with TypeScript in your monorepo and want type safety across your code.
Without this field, TypeScript won't know where to find the types, which could result in missing type definitions or errors. -->
